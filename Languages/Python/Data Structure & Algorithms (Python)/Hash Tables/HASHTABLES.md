** Hash Tables **

1. Create an empty list (it can also be a dictionary or a set).
2. Create a hash function.
3. Inserting an element using a hash function.
4. Looking up an element using a hash function.
5. Handling collisions.

Hash Tables are great for:

- Checking if something is in a collection (like finding a book in a library).
- Storing unique items and quickly finding them (like storing phone numbers).
- Connecting values to keys (like linking names to phone numbers).
