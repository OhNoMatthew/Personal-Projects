** Merge Sort **

Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))

How it works:
1. Divide the unsorted array into two sub-arrays, half the size of the original.
2. Continue to divide the sub-arrays as long as the current piece of the array has more than one element.
3. Merge two sub-arrays together by always putting the lowest value first.
4. Keep merging until there are no sub-arrays left.
