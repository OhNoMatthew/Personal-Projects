Hi there 👋 I'm Matthew
I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree. I'm passionate about continuous learning, self-improvement, and tackling challenges through code.

Interests:

💻 Full-Stack Web Development

⚙️ Software Engineering

🎮 Game Development

I’m always eager to grow, build meaningful projects, and learn something new every day.

This is a space where I add all my known coding files. 

List of Languages within the file:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- C++ (In the future)

I will plan to add more files in the near future.

Patch Notes 7/25/2025 :
- Added Permutations and Combination fucntion (Needs fixing)
- Added Random (Choice, Sample, Choices) function
- Added Open file function

** Pick a Number Game **
- I just uploaded this game (7/25/2025, 5:47 PM)
- I had some difficulty with try and except code LOL

Logs: (??)
- I don't think this will be a permanent feature but I will try my best to add some logs.
- I would need to fix the perms and combs function. For some reason the code is working but is giving an syntax error to the code
