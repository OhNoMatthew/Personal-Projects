Hi there 👋 I'm Matthew
I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree. I'm passionate about continuous learning, self-improvement, and tackling challenges through code.

Interests:

⚙️ Software Engineering

🎮 Game Development

🔐 Cyber Security

I’m always eager to grow, build meaningful projects, and learn something new every day.

This is a space where I add all my known coding files. 

List of Languages within the file:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeSript (Future)
- HTML
- CSS
- React (Future)
- C++ (Future)

I will plan to add more files in the near future.
