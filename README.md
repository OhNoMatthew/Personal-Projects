Hi there 👋 I'm Matthew
I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree. I'm passionate about continuous learning, self-improvement, and tackling challenges through code.

Interests:

💻 Full-Stack Web Development

⚙️ Software Engineering

🎮 Game Development

🔐 Cyber Security

I’m always eager to grow, build meaningful projects, and learn something new every day.

This is a space where I add all my known coding files. 

List of Languages within the file:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- C++ (In the future)

I will plan to add more files in the near future.

Patch Notes 7/28/2025 :
- Worked on the Guess the Number game

** Guess the Number Game **
- I just uploaded this game (7/25/2025, 5:47 PM)
- I added wins. Each time you guess a number right you get a win added to your record. ( Goes for all modes )

** BUG FIXES **
  - It would give errors and exit the program if you enter nothing while picking a number
UPDATE - Turns out you get two guesses within picking numbers. I'm thinking of keeping it maybe so it might not be a bug?

Logs: (??)
** I don't think this will be a permanent feature but I will try my best to add some logs. **
- I didn't work much this weekend. I was busy this weekend but it was also good timing so I wouldn't burn myself out with just coding.
